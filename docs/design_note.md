Consideration, Goal,

unify representation for rendering and editing. simple data structure, yet fast subdivision.

direct subdivision from editable mesh.

contiguous sequential array update, (performance)

DirectedEdge Array, (performance, easy update, subdivision)

use ptex/htex 

avoid false sharing

parallel implementation (gpu), [cpu](multithread.md)

wasm, (sharedtypearray is slow? )

good name, [sane api](api.md)

Limitation/PitFall

directededge must be contiguous without hole or freed space.

so we needs flexibility to handle the editing operation, and the underlying data can be optimized and contiguous at will.(@done, 2023/12)
