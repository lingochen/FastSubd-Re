"Simple and Efficient Mesh Layout with Space-Filling Curves" by Huy T. Vo

simple to implemented, fast, and get very good result. good cpu cache behavior too.


"Revisiting The Vertex Cache: Understanding and Optimizing Vertex Processing on the modern GPU"

vertex reused is batch-based rather than central post tranform caching. so morton order is good enough.
