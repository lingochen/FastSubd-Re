[opensubdiv](https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/overview.html) Fast but complicated subdivision library. Made by Pixar.

[OpenMesh](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/) Good, traditional HalfEdge implementation.

[Geometry-Central](https://geometry-central.net/) Another angle on HalfEdge implementation.

[Polygon Mesh Processing Library](https://www.pmp-library.org/) Learned lesson from OpenMesh, somewhat similar to Geometry-Central. Customization is supposedly easier than OpenMesh.

[CMU Scotty3D](https://www.github.com/CMU-Graphics/Scotty3D) cmu 3d model editor course. Good learning resource.

Howto use halfEdge to [Add_Face](https://kaba.hilvi.org/pastel-1.5.0/pastel/geometry/halfmesh/halfmesh.htm). Extremely good reference on the implementation detail.

[HalfEdge in Game](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/half-edge-based-mesh-representations-practice/). Very good stories on implementing HalfEdge for game.

[Procedural Generation using halfEdge](https://martindevans.me/game-development/2016/03/30/Procedural-Generation-For-Dummies-Half-Edge-Geometry/). a beginner level introduction.
